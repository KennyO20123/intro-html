I am someone who to be very honest with you, has been fearful for a lot of my life. 
Fearful of my future, fearful if I am making the right decisions to currently bring about positive effects moving forward.
Fearful if I can achieve more than what I know and have seen.  I didn't come from a household or environment that provided examples of what other possibilities there were that can be attainable outside what I saw. 
To cut a long story short, I knew education was paramount and I had to do the work.  That was the one thing that I knew I could do at the very least and I stuck to it.  I was able to go to St. John's University and also get a masters.
Coding was something I pursued when I was in the 8th grade because I wanted to know how to build websites and make them look a certain way.  I would think of so many futuristic ideas of how I wanted a page to look and interact with those who visited.  I wish I knew then or a bit later on, that it could've been a career option for me.  Not to say that I would have just stuck with it for that, but to have stuck with it for the fact that I would have been able to brush off some comments like "You're wasting your time" or "you focus on that too much and not your school work".  It was a hobby I thoroughly enjoyed doing and  in building this page so much came back to me in regards to using html, it's stuff that I never forgot.
I have done my research on coding programs and almost all run on the 15 week bootcamp style curriculum, which is very tempting but very flawed as well.  I know some just put their cohort through their program and place them wherever afterwards just to say they have a job placement rate.  What I have noticed about The Knowledge House is that not only is the program taken seriously but there is a true investment in the fellows.  It is an encouraging environment, which I wish I had when I was younger and is aimed at the success of the fellows, not just career wise but as an overall person to make sure one can leave confident enough to pursue this field that they have chosen.  I like how The Knowledge House pushes their fellows to go secure their own internships, even though the program has its own connections.  What this program does is givensomeone the skills that are truly needed in this industry by not rushing the process and allowing someone to take initiative creating their future career.  It is a fair exchange between both parties where there is a common goal for success and enjoyment in the tech field.  It is a well thought out and executed program that truly wants to see the best for their fellows and be a positive representation in the tech field.  For reasons like this is why I am interested in being a TKH Innovation Fellow.
